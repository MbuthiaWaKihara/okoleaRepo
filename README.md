# Purpose
<p>
Okolea Platform is a website that allows students to gain access to and share good revision material
</p>

<p>
The inspiration for such a system like Okolea came from an experience we had, as university students, while trying to efficiently prepare for continous assesment tests, and examinations. We found that the higher edicational institutes nature of not having fixed course material for students, unlike the rest of the 8-4-4 system in Kenya, left a majority of students to rely on their own skills to find good revision material. Higher institutions, especially public ones, also don't have a well organized way of archiving material used by students at a certain point in time. This creates a kind of unfair ground for the students, with some students failing to exhaust their potential due to poor research skills. 
</p>

<p>
Okolea is a platform that relies on the students themselves to grow. The system not only acts as a good archive for past papers and notes, but also enables students to share resources they consider helpful with others. Okolea's idea is that a selected group of students (class representatives/ student leaders) are able to upload material directly into the website, and are also able to verify material uploaded by other students. This way, someone is always accountable for every upload in the site.
